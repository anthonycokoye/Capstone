# **World Bank Capstone Proposal**
#### Political Economy of Climate Change - P180308
#### Proposed by: World Bank Group
#### World Bank Technical Lead: Ryan Rafaty
#### Email: firstname_lastname@worldbank.org
#### Advisor(s): Amir Jafari & Edwin Lo
#### The George Washington University, Washington DC  
#### Data Science Program


### **PROJECT INFORMATION:**
#### 1. What is your name?  
Ryan Rafaty


#### 2. What is the full name of your unit?
##### e.g., LAC Transportation or Energy Global Practice
Public Institutions Data and Analytics Unit of the Governance Global Practice


#### 3. What is the name and P-code for your project?
Political Economy of Climate Change - P180308


#### 4. Are you the TTL / Project Lead? If not, please enter their name and email here:
Laura Zoratto - lzoratto@worldbank.org


#### 5. Please list other team members involved in the project:
Verena Fritz - vfritz@worldbank.org
Ryan Rafaty - rrafaty@worldbank.org
Abdulaziz Almuzaini - aalmuzaini@worldbank.org
Chiara Bronchi - cbronchi@worldbank.org



### **CHALLENGE:**
#### 6. Where is your challenge? 
##### i.e., which county, city, country, and/or region
Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC), broadly speaking, with particular attention to the LMICs with whom the Bank's Governance Global Practice is currently
engaged in public financial management reforms that will support national responses to the risks of climate change.



#### 7. What is the challenge you are trying to solve?
Mitigating and adapting to the risks of anthropogenic climate change requires foresighted, strategic, and expeditious action from national governments. Countries
have adopted different approaches to climate change, both with respect to mitigation and adaptation, and we don’t fully
understand why. While much is already known about the inherent difficulties of climate policymaking, much less is known about (1) the institutional design
features that may help in mitigating or overcoming fundamental problems in the global cooperative effort; (2) factors that are driving variation in climate policies at
national and subnational levels; and (3) driving forces
of climate policy beyond the state, in particular civil society, the science-policy interface, and public opinion. The Climate Change Institutional Assessment (CCIA)
and the Country-Level Institutional Assessment and Review (CLIAR) database are two of the products of the World Bank's Governance Global Practice. Working
with our Unit, the student will apply their applied econometric and/or data science skills to help us further develop the data and analytics underpinning CCIAs and
CLIAR. The work will assist in providing guidance on conducting systematic, context-driven, and empirically grounded reviews of national institutions, with the goal
of influencing climate policy dialogue and informing the design of country engagement products.



#### 8. Who would be the beneficiaries of the solution?

The World Bank's Public Institutions Data and Analytics Unit, within the Governance Global Practice, provides strategy and support for within-country governance
reforms, serves as a hub for data on government and governance patterns in developing countries, and supports a repository of key global, regional, and country
analytical studies. The main beneficiaries of the data and analytics produced in this project will be the client governments, civil servants, and citizens of the lowand middle-income countries with whom the Bank's Governance Global Practice is engaged in climate-related lending, public financial management reform, and
development policy financing.
            



### **STATUS AND TIMELINE:**
#### 9. What is the status of your project/challenge?
##### e.g., early ideation; concept note; supervision; etc.
Stage II (currently undergoing internal quality enhancement review, with a view towards launching a revamped version of both CCIAs and the CLIAR database).
            



#### 10. Are there milestones or hard deadlines we should be aware of? If so, please describe: 

CCIA enhancement is an ongoing endeavor, while the CLIAR database (2.0) will be launched in the first quarter of 2024. We will be regularly updating and
upgrading the underlying data and analytics that feed into both of these knowledge products.
            


#### 11. Does the team have a technical lead who could regularly meet with the students? 
Yes



### **DATA:**
#### 12. What is the approximate size of your dataset to be analyzed by the students?
##### e.g., 100 GB
Less than 1 GB



#### 13. Type of data? 

1. Time series/Panel data
            


#### 14. Could you please provide more details regarding the nature of the data?

The CLIAR database consists of a large number of variables from multiple (World Bank and other) data sources. The variables are in panel time series format
(cross-country, 1990-2022), with over 180 countries included. The data contained within it relate to political, institutional, economic, and policy-related features of
countries, and the information is used to inform the Bank's Climate Change Institutional Assessment (CCIA) of countries, a data product that feeds into the Bank's
Country Climate and Development Reports (CCDR).
            


#### 15. It is important that students can begin their project work as soon as their course commences, to ensure completion
before the close of their semester. Could the students immediately access the data upon project commencement? If your data requires additional World Bank
credentials to gain access, could you commit to helping the student gain the necessary credentials within 10-days of the start of the project?  Are there other uncertainties around data access that the program should be aware of? e.g., If the project requires student access to data not owned by the World Bank, students may need to be hired as non-fee STCs.
The student would be able to access the underlying data immediately upon commencement of the project.



#### 16. Would the team be able to provide a sample of data if the project is preselected?
Yes


#### 17. What is the ultimate goal of this project? Is it more about finding interesting insights from the data, or is it more about making
accurate predictions, or something else? Does the data have the essential information (important features and/or labels) to accomplish this goal?
The ultimate goal of the project is to (i) identify additional variables that could be included in the database, either through the identification of new sources of data
or through manipulation of existing variables in the database; (ii) to produce compelling visualizations of the panel data that can be used to compare how
countries are situated across multiple dimensions in relation to other countries; (iii) to enhance our understanding of how different institutional features are linked
to particular climate and development policy outcomes.



#### 18. Any additional comments or links to further information?
