# **World Bank Capstone Proposal**
#### Economic Development through a Spatial Lens. RA-P180214-RESE-TF0B979
#### Proposed by: World Bank Group
#### World Bank Technical Lead: Alejandro Molnar
#### Email: firstname_lastname@worldbank.org
#### Advisor(s): Amir Jafari & Edwin Lo
#### The George Washington University, Washington DC  
#### Data Science Program


### **PROJECT INFORMATION:**
#### 1. What is your name?  
Alejandro Molnar


#### 2. What is the full name of your unit?
##### e.g., LAC Transportation or Energy Global Practice
Development Research Group


#### 3. What is the name and P-code for your project?
Economic Development through a Spatial Lens. RA-P180214-RESE-TF0B979


#### 4. Are you the TTL / Project Lead? If not, please enter their name and email here:
Forhad Shilpi, fshilip@worldbank.org


#### 5. Please list other team members involved in the project:
Matias Navarro, PhD student, Cornell University



### **CHALLENGE:**
#### 6. Where is your challenge? 
##### i.e., which county, city, country, and/or region
Multiple projects, depending on student fit and interest:
- Bangladesh
- India
- Rwanda
- Cape Town, South Africa



#### 7. What is the challenge you are trying to solve?
- Bangladesh: value of bridges to transportation network connectivity
- India: analysis of freight costs using data from a digital freight matching platform
- Rwanda: analysis of telemetry data
- Cape Town: impact on commuters from transportation service quality


#### 8. Who would be the beneficiaries of the solution?

All projects are academic research, beneficiaries vary by project
            



### **STATUS AND TIMELINE:**
#### 9. What is the status of your project/challenge?
##### e.g., early ideation; concept note; supervision; etc.
Varies by project, can adapt to student requirements and availability
            



#### 10. Are there milestones or hard deadlines we should be aware of? If so, please describe: 

Varies by project, can adapt to student availability
            


#### 11. Does the team have a technical lead who could regularly meet with the students? 
Yes



### **DATA:**
#### 12. What is the approximate size of your dataset to be analyzed by the students?
##### e.g., 100 GB
Varies, from 2 gb to 50gb



#### 13. Type of data? 

1. Text
2. Image
3. Time series/Panel data
4. Tabular
            


#### 14. Could you please provide more details regarding the nature of the data?

Many types of data and tasks, can be adapted based on student capabilities and interest.
            


#### 15. It is important that students can begin their project work as soon as their course commences, to ensure completion
before the close of their semester. Could the students immediately access the data upon project commencement? If your data requires additional World Bank
credentials to gain access, could you commit to helping the student gain the necessary credentials within 10-days of the start of the project?  Are there other uncertainties around data access that the program should be aware of? e.g., If the project requires student access to data not owned by the World Bank, students may need to be hired as non-fee STCs.
Yes



#### 16. Would the team be able to provide a sample of data if the project is preselected?
Yes


#### 17. What is the ultimate goal of this project? Is it more about finding interesting insights from the data, or is it more about making
accurate predictions, or something else? Does the data have the essential information (important features and/or labels) to accomplish this goal?
The ultimate goals are estimating parameters in economic models, and producing quantitative insights from those models. The goal is not prediction.


#### 18. Any additional comments or links to further information?
A brief discussion w/ academic advisors might be required to identify fit.
