# **World Bank Capstone Proposal**
#### Accelerating Adoption of Fast Payments in Low and Middle Income Countries (P180236)
#### Proposed by: World Bank Group
#### World Bank Technical Lead: Holti Banka
#### Email: firstname_lastname@worldbank.org
#### Advisor(s): Amir Jafari & Edwin Lo
#### The George Washington University, Washington DC  
#### Data Science Program


### **PROJECT INFORMATION:**
#### 1. What is your name?  
Holti Banka


#### 2. What is the full name of your unit?
##### e.g., LAC Transportation or Energy Global Practice
Financial Inclusion, Infrastructure & Access (EFNFI)


#### 3. What is the name and P-code for your project?
Accelerating Adoption of Fast Payments in Low and Middle Income Countries (P180236)


#### 4. Are you the TTL / Project Lead? If not, please enter their name and email here:
Yes


#### 5. Please list other team members involved in the project:
Oya Ardic



### **CHALLENGE:**
#### 6. Where is your challenge? 
##### i.e., which county, city, country, and/or region
Global scope of domestic and cross-border corridors.


#### 7. What is the challenge you are trying to solve?
We are establishing an innovative dataset/methodology that would collect, analyze and disseminate costs associated with domestic and cross-border payment
transactions across different payment methods, transaction channels and payment service providers around the world.


#### 8. Who would be the beneficiaries of the solution?

Central banks, governments, academia, policy/research institutes, think tanks, donor community, financial institutions, international development organizations.
            



### **STATUS AND TIMELINE:**
#### 9. What is the status of your project/challenge?
##### e.g., early ideation; concept note; supervision; etc.
The methodology and data analysis on the domestic payment costs is in early stages while the equivalent methodology on the cross-border payment costs is
advances but new ideas are being explored on data analysis and data visualization.
            



#### 10. Are there milestones or hard deadlines we should be aware of? If so, please describe: 

Reports based on new types of data analysis and data visualization are expected to be generated by the end of the project.
            


#### 11. Does the team have a technical lead who could regularly meet with the students? 
Yes



### **DATA:**
#### 12. What is the approximate size of your dataset to be analyzed by the students?
##### e.g., 100 GB
About 15 MB


#### 13. Type of data? 

1. Time series/Panel data
            


#### 14. Could you please provide more details regarding the nature of the data?

A mix of quantitative and qualitative data, focusing on the costs borne by end users when sending/receiving a domestic or cross-border payment, by type of
provide (bank, non-bank), by payment method (cash, card, e-money, credit transfer), by speed, by transaction channel (branch, internet, mobile, etc).
            


#### 15. It is important that students can begin their project work as soon as their course commences, to ensure completion
before the close of their semester. Could the students immediately access the data upon project commencement? If your data requires additional World Bank
credentials to gain access, could you commit to helping the student gain the necessary credentials within 10-days of the start of the project?  Are there other uncertainties around data access that the program should be aware of? e.g., If the project requires student access to data not owned by the World Bank, students may need to be hired as non-fee STCs.
They can have immediate access.



#### 16. Would the team be able to provide a sample of data if the project is preselected?
Yes


#### 17. What is the ultimate goal of this project? Is it more about finding interesting insights from the data, or is it more about making
accurate predictions, or something else? Does the data have the essential information (important features and/or labels) to accomplish this goal?
Finding new insights, patterns from the data, as well as visualizing the data in a more meaningful way. The data has the essential information to accomplish this
goal.


#### 18. Any additional comments or links to further information?
This particular dataset is one of the most cited World Bank datasets in the international development community.
