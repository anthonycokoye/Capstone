    "challenge_type": "Transport decarbonization in the EU and fair transition: The European Union is the world\u2019s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and transportation is\ncurrently the second-largest source of emissions in the EU, representing 29% of energy sector emissions. Unlike other EU economic sectors that have successfully\ndecreased emissions, the transport sector has witnessed a significant increase in emissions since 1990. Decarbonizing the transport sector by 2050, as per the EU\nGreen Deal ambition, will therefore require humongous efforts on technological transition, but also on policy and institutional frameworks that lead to more\nsustainable transport systems (with higher modal shares of public transport and rail and intermodal freight transport). In addition, this transition needs to be done\nin a fair manner, not leaving behind low-income households and small enterprises.\nWhile the decarbonization objective is set at regional level, the challenges faced by different countries differ greatly, considering the different macroeconomic\nconditions, energy-systems characteristics, market dynamics, and institutional frameworks. Identifying the key challenges faced by some of the countries in the\nregion to achieve the transport climate objective in a fair manner requires both quantitative and qualitative analysis.\nThe World Bank is developing analytical work to identify the key challenges to decarbonize the transport sector in Europe, looking at the specific challenges in\ndifferent transport subsectors, through the lenses of 3 cross-cutting areas: 1) Financing transport decarbonization, 2) Innovation and technology diffusion, and 3)\nInstitutional and governance reforms.\n",

    "ultimate_goal": "The objective of the project is to identify the key challenges faced by countries in the region to achieve the transport decarbonization objectives, and provide\nrecommendations, based on data-analysis, to overcome these challenges and accelerate the transition. Based on the students\u2019 interest, this could be focused on a\nspecific transport subsector (e.g., zero-emission trucks, sustainable mobility in metropolitan and urban areas, or strengthening of the rail freight sector), and the\nanalysis could focus on one of the following areas: 1) Analysis of trends that point to country-specific challenges to decarbonize the transport sector, assessing the\ndifferent contexts across EU member states and accession countries. For instance, using the data to analyze how growing motorization rates in some countries,\ncoupled with high reliance on second-hand imports and longer vehicle lifespans, may delay the decarbonization of the road sector; 2) Econometric analysis to\ncompute elasticities of transport demand with respect to a subset of variables, in order to improve future demand projections for the countries in the region under\ndifferent scenarios; 3) Analysis of potential innovative financing to accelerate transport decarbonization (e.g., introducing residual value guarantees to facilitate\nleasing solutions for zero-emission vehicles); 4) Identification of potential green trade corridors in the region to catalyze innovation and accelerate green logistics;\n5) Explore options to facilitate access to commercial financing for transport State-Owned Enterprises in the region and policies to improve their performance.\n",
