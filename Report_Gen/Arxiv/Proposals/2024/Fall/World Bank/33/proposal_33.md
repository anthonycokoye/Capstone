### **CHALLENGE:**
#### 6. Where is your challenge? 
##### i.e., which county, city, country, and/or region
Nigeria


#### 7. What is the challenge you are trying to solve?
NFWP utilizes Women Affinity Groups (WAGs), a variation of Self-Help Groups as platforms to build women’s human, financial and social capital. The WAGs meet
on a regular basis to (a) save, pool their savings, and lend money to each other on a rotating basis start or expand business, pay for healthcare or education
expenses, or meet other financial needs.; (b) receive training in key areas such as financial education, business skills, negotiation, gender, and life skills etc. from
Ward Facilitators. As a result, membership of WAGs helps women:
i. access to credit, savings, and insurance services that enable women to start and grow their businesses. This helps in generating income and achieving financial
independence, which leads to the economic empowerment of women
ii. improve the social status of women by giving them a voice in decision-making processes in their households and communities
iii. promote social capital by creating a supportive environment for women to share their experiences, ideas, and knowledge. This fosters self-esteem, self-confidence, and leadership skills, and enables women to participate in decision-making processes in their households and communities
iv. reduce poverty by providing an avenue for women to access credit and savings, thereby enabling them to invest in income-generating activities. This leads to
increased household income and improved standards of living.
v. engage in advocacy and collective action to address broader social and economic issues affecting their community.
We would like to digitize the processes of the Women Affinity Groups under the Nigeria for Women project. It is expected that by automating calculations for
savings, loan repayments, fines, and savings balances, such applications will reduce time spent on financial transactions that are core to the WAGs.



#### 8. Who would be the beneficiaries of the solution?

low-income unbanked women
            



### **STATUS AND TIMELINE:**
#### 9. What is the status of your project/challenge?
##### e.g., early ideation; concept note; supervision; etc.
Supervision
            



#### 10. Are there milestones or hard deadlines we should be aware of? If so, please describe: 

The NFWP Scale Up is expected to become effective by December 15 2023
            


#### 11. Does the team have a technical lead who could regularly meet with the students? 
Yes



### **DATA:**
#### 12. What is the approximate size of your dataset to be analyzed by the students?
##### e.g., 100 GB
100GB



#### 13. Type of data? 

1. Text
            


#### 14. Could you please provide more details regarding the nature of the data?

Women's savings data
            


#### 15. It is important that students can begin their project work as soon as their course commences, to ensure completion
before the close of their semester. Could the students immediately access the data upon project commencement? If your data requires additional World Bank
credentials to gain access, could you commit to helping the student gain the necessary credentials within 10-days of the start of the project?  Are there other uncertainties around data access that the program should be aware of? e.g., If the project requires student access to data not owned by the World Bank, students may need to be hired as non-fee STCs.
Yes



#### 16. Would the team be able to provide a sample of data if the project is preselected?
Yes


#### 17. What is the ultimate goal of this project? Is it more about finding interesting insights from the data, or is it more about making
accurate predictions, or something else? Does the data have the essential information (important features and/or labels) to accomplish this goal?
We hope the project can support the development of a digital savings group Application



#### 18. Any additional comments or links to further information?
NIL
