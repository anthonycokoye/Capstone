# **World Bank Capstone Proposal**
#### P179939
#### Proposed by: World Bank Group
#### World Bank Technical Lead: Megersa Abate
#### Email: firstname_lastname@worldbank.org
#### Advisor(s): Amir Jafari & Edwin Lo
#### The George Washington University, Washington DC  
#### Data Science Program


### **PROJECT INFORMATION:**
#### 1. What is your name?  
Megersa Abate


#### 2. What is the full name of your unit?
##### e.g., LAC Transportation or Energy Global Practice
Global Unit Transport


#### 3. What is the name and P-code for your project?
P179939


#### 4. Are you the TTL / Project Lead? If not, please enter their name and email here:
Charles Kunaka


#### 5. Please list other team members involved in the project:
Kisanet Haile Molla



### **CHALLENGE:**
#### 6. Where is your challenge? 
##### i.e., which county, city, country, and/or region
Africa


#### 7. What is the challenge you are trying to solve?
The Transport Global Knowledge Unit is building a freight transport model to inform its investment prioritization and planning decision and respond to growing
global challenges such as decarbonization, food transportation and logistics. The modeling work aims to provide a fresh, independent, and comprehensive view of
connectivity needs of client countries in these regions and their decision-making processes. It draws upon and seeks to integrate existing work that the World
Bank and other stakeholders have carried out on infrastructure and logistics connectivity and propose a purely technical approach to support the coordination and
prioritization of projects.
The objective of the assignment is to update and continue further development of the transport model (FLOWMAX) and lay the ground for the detailed modelling
that needs to be carried out to identify and prioritize investments in trade and transport corridors linking parts of the MENA, SAR, North/East Africa and ECA to
their main trade partners. It is also aims to apply FLOWMAX to assess the nexus of transport and food and fertilizer systems in Sub-Sharan Africa by defining a
transport connectivity and logistics infrastructure improvement program to strengthen the resilience of food and fertilizer systems in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).


#### 8. Who would be the beneficiaries of the solution?

Bank staff, policy makers in client countries and their citizens.
            



### **STATUS AND TIMELINE:**
#### 9. What is the status of your project/challenge?
##### e.g., early ideation; concept note; supervision; etc.
Implementation n
            



#### 10. Are there milestones or hard deadlines we should be aware of? If so, please describe: 

project ending in FY24, but with possibility of extension
            


#### 11. Does the team have a technical lead who could regularly meet with the students? 
Yes



### **DATA:**
#### 12. What is the approximate size of your dataset to be analyzed by the students?
##### e.g., 100 GB
100 GB


#### 13. Type of data? 

1. Text
2. Image
3. Time series/Panel data
4. Tabular
            


#### 14. Could you please provide more details regarding the nature of the data?

transport flows between regions, border crossing points
            


#### 15. It is important that students can begin their project work as soon as their course commences, to ensure completion
before the close of their semester. Could the students immediately access the data upon project commencement? If your data requires additional World Bank
credentials to gain access, could you commit to helping the student gain the necessary credentials within 10-days of the start of the project?  Are there other uncertainties around data access that the program should be aware of? e.g., If the project requires student access to data not owned by the World Bank, students may need to be hired as non-fee STCs.
not at the movement.



#### 16. Would the team be able to provide a sample of data if the project is preselected?
Yes


#### 17. What is the ultimate goal of this project? Is it more about finding interesting insights from the data, or is it more about making
accurate predictions, or something else? Does the data have the essential information (important features and/or labels) to accomplish this goal?
building a well functioning transport model


#### 18. Any additional comments or links to further information?
NA
