# **World Bank Capstone Proposal**
#### P181147
#### Proposed by: World Bank Group
#### World Bank Technical Lead: Meghana Rao Pahlajani
#### Email: firstname_lastname@worldbank.org
#### Advisor(s): Amir Jafari & Edwin Lo
#### The George Washington University, Washington DC  
#### Data Science Program


### **PROJECT INFORMATION:**
#### 1. What is your name?  
Meghana Rao Pahlajani


#### 2. What is the full name of your unit?
##### e.g., LAC Transportation or Energy Global Practice
2030 Water Resources Group - SWARG


#### 3. What is the name and P-code for your project?
P181147


#### 4. Are you the TTL / Project Lead? If not, please enter their name and email here:
TTL - Ajith Radhakrishnan - aradhakrishnan3@worldbank.org


#### 5. Please list other team members involved in the project:
Meghana Rao Pahlajani, Yogesh Bandhu Arya



### **CHALLENGE:**
#### 6. Where is your challenge? 
##### i.e., which county, city, country, and/or region
Uttar Pradesh, India



#### 7. What is the challenge you are trying to solve?
Small and marginal farmers in India, currently have limited capacity to afford purchasing of farm equipment to support their agricultural processes. They rely on
Custom Hiring Centers (CHC) to rent out farm equipment based on their requirements.
However, there is a lack of standardization in the rates at which this equipment is available for rent, often leading to a distortion in the rental prices and preventing
access to these mechanization solutions. Additionally, when the demand for specific equipment increases, the prices for rental can become prohibitively high,
further restricting access to the rental market.
The challenge we are trying to solve for is the variability in the pricing strategy for farm equipment rental in agricultural areas to ensure increased access,
availability and affordability for small and marginal farmers to ensure increased agricultural productivity.



#### 8. Who would be the beneficiaries of the solution?

The beneficiaries of the solution would be:
A) Farmers: The standardizing of rates for farm equipment rental would allow for a more predictable budgeting by the farmers so they can avail of mechanization
services in their agricultural processes.
B) Custom Hiring Centers: The pricing guidelines can support the Custom hiring centers better manage their operations when faced with fluctuations in demand
C) Government: The Government would benefit from setting guidelines on the range of prices that the farm equipment can be rented out at to ensure that farm
equipment accessibility is increased and exploitative pricing is stopped.
            



### **STATUS AND TIMELINE:**
#### 9. What is the status of your project/challenge?
##### e.g., early ideation; concept note; supervision; etc.
The 2030 WRG is supported a program by the Government of Uttar Pradesh to support climate smart agriculture in the State. The program focuses on improving
agricultural productivity, enhancing water use efficiency and reducing carbon emissions.
The program was formalized in December 2022, and is currently in the implementation stage. The solution to address mechanization and develop farm equipment
rental pricing models is in the conceptualization stage.
            



#### 10. Are there milestones or hard deadlines we should be aware of? If so, please describe: 

The program seeks to work closely on integrating the pricing strategy along with the other initiatives to support agricultural mechanization. The current tentative
timelines for this integration is between March - June 2024.
            


#### 11. Does the team have a technical lead who could regularly meet with the students? 
Yes



### **DATA:**
#### 12. What is the approximate size of your dataset to be analyzed by the students?
##### e.g., 100 GB
40 GB



#### 13. Type of data? 

1. Tabular
            


#### 14. Could you please provide more details regarding the nature of the data?

The data that will be provided on the current rental rates and equipment demand over time periods (daily, seasonally) for 30 Custom Hiring Centers across the
focus, Uttar Pradesh and for an additional 10 Custom Hiring Centers in other states as reference data.
            


#### 15. It is important that students can begin their project work as soon as their course commences, to ensure completion
before the close of their semester. Could the students immediately access the data upon project commencement? If your data requires additional World Bank
credentials to gain access, could you commit to helping the student gain the necessary credentials within 10-days of the start of the project?  Are there other uncertainties around data access that the program should be aware of? e.g., If the project requires student access to data not owned by the World Bank, students may need to be hired as non-fee STCs.
No Additional data or access will be required.



#### 16. Would the team be able to provide a sample of data if the project is preselected?
Yes


#### 17. What is the ultimate goal of this project? Is it more about finding interesting insights from the data, or is it more about making
accurate predictions, or something else? Does the data have the essential information (important features and/or labels) to accomplish this goal?
The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a pricing strategy that would support affordability and access to farm equipment for small and marginal farmers. This
will be integration with policy and regulatory level guidelines that govern the operation of Custom Hiring Centers. The focus is on developing an algorithm and modelling framework that can be used for this context.
Yes, the data will have the essential information required to accomplish this goal.



#### 18. Any additional comments or links to further information?
Once the results of this modelling have been validated at a field level, it can be scaled to similar applications across geographies as well. It will help in developing
pricing related strategies which can reflect in policy level mechanization decisions as well.
