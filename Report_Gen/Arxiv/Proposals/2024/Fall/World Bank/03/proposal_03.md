# **World Bank Capstone Proposal**
#### REGIONAL RAILWAY CONNECTIVITY IN MENA: BETWEEN GCC AND MASHREQ COUNTRIES AND BEYOND (P178510)
#### Proposed by: World Bank Group
#### World Bank Technical Lead: Muneeza Alam
#### Email: firstname_lastname@worldbank.org
#### Advisor(s): Amir Jafari & Edwin Lo
#### The George Washington University, Washington DC  
#### Data Science Program


### **PROJECT INFORMATION:**
#### 1. What is your name?  
Muneeza Alam


#### 2. What is the full name of your unit?
##### e.g., LAC Transportation or Energy Global Practice
MENA Transport Global Practice


#### 3. What is the name and P-code for your project?
REGIONAL RAILWAY CONNECTIVITY IN MENA: BETWEEN GCC AND MASHREQ COUNTRIES AND BEYOND (P178510)


#### 4. Are you the TTL / Project Lead? If not, please enter their name and email here:
Yes


#### 5. Please list other team members involved in the project:

Nobu Daito
Roger Gorham
Joanna Moody
Robin Carruthers
            



### **CHALLENGE:**
#### 6. Where is your challenge? 
##### i.e., which county, city, country, and/or region
Middle East and North Africa


#### 7. What is the challenge you are trying to solve?
Assess the demand potential for high- and medium- speed passenger railways


#### 8. Who would be the beneficiaries of the solution?

The primary beneficiaries will be the transport ministries of countries in the Middle East and North Africa. High Speed and Medium Speed Railways are a new but potentially growing line of business in MNA. Many countries in the region are already building or have announced plans to build High Speed Railways . In the next five years, we expect countries in MENA to approach the WB for advice and support in the future Therefore, undertaking this activity will yield significant benefits in the future. The ASA is also expected to yield tangible benefits for the current pipeline portfolio and will inform the ongoing operational engagement. By examining the potential for HSRs, the ASA will contribute to ongoing Bank-financed investments supporting economic corridor development, with a long-term view of transforming MENA into a preeminent connectivity node.
            



### **STATUS AND TIMELINE:**
#### 9. What is the status of your project/challenge?
##### e.g., early ideation; concept note; supervision; etc.
We want to undertake some exploratory analysis to estimate the demand potential for high and medium speed railways in MENA.\ We want to estimate a gravity model to address the following questions:\ 1. Would High Speed or Medium Speed railways provide a competitive alternative within the MNA region that can shift travel away from more polluting modes, like air and road?\ 2. Under what circumstances (for example, pricing regimes) and on what routes would HSR or conventional railways have the most potential demand/ridership?\ We have access to aviation data that would be useful for this work and many other datasets.
            



#### 10. Are there milestones or hard deadlines we should be aware of? If so, please describe: 

The exploratory work needs to be completed by end of December 2023. The eventual goal is that this model would become a Working Paper in the World Bank Working Paper Series.
            


#### 11. Does the team have a technical lead who could regularly meet with the students? 
Yes



### **DATA:**
#### 12. What is the approximate size of your dataset to be analyzed by the students?
##### e.g., 100 GB
1-5 GB


#### 13. Type of data? 

1. Tabular
2. We have different datasets that will be used. All of them are quantitate in nature. Geospatial elements will also be important.
            


#### 14. Could you please provide more details regarding the nature of the data?

1. Aviation data (OAG-Official Airline Guide: the Official Airline Guide (OAG) is an air travel intelligence reference that provides data on airline schedules, cargo and aviation analytics)
2. Population data from WorldPop)
3. Data on AADT by highway sections
4. Border crossing data for cars
5. Proposed alignment of regional railways indicating which cities will be connected by highspeed and mediumspeed railways.
            


#### 15. It is important that students can begin their project work as soon as their course commences, to ensure completion
before the close of their semester. Could the students immediately access the data upon project commencement? If your data requires additional World Bank
credentials to gain access, could you commit to helping the student gain the necessary credentials within 10-days of the start of the project?  Are there other uncertainties around data access that the program should be aware of? e.g., If the project requires student access to data not owned by the World Bank, students may need to be hired as non-fee STCs.
Yes



#### 16. Would the team be able to provide a sample of data if the project is preselected?
Yes


#### 17. What is the ultimate goal of this project? Is it more about finding interesting insights from the data, or is it more about making
accurate predictions, or something else? Does the data have the essential information (important features and/or labels) to accomplish this goal?
The ultimate goal of the project is to assess how much modal shift from air transport and road transport) could be attracted to high and medium speed railways if 
            they were built in the Middle East and North Africa Region.


#### 18. Any additional comments or links to further information?
Nothing to be noted.
