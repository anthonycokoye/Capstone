  "Challenge": {
    "challenge_location": "Bhutan\n",
    "challenge_type": "The agricultural sector in Bhutan is at a crossroad with market opportunities arising from growing demand for high value products in urban and domestic markets\nwhile at the same time the sector struggles with low productivity, limited value addition, and increasing vulnerability to climate change. Agriculture continues to be\nBhutan\u2019s main employer (48%), especially in rural areas, despite declining contribution to GDP (19%). Bhutan has experienced only slow growth in agricultural\nvalue added per worker (1% annually) which is dwarfed by the performance of aspirational peer countries undergoing a successful structural transformation. The\nmain constraints to productivity are crop damages caused by wildlife, pests, and diseases; irrigation and water management issues; limited access to modern\ninputs and technologies; and climate-change induced yield variability. While half of Bhutan\u2019s harvested area comes from irrigated and rainfed paddy and rainfed\nmaize, the area dedicated to these crops and their yield has declined in recent year. In contrast, agricultural production for selected cash crops (cardamom and\nareca nuts) and fruits (mandarins) has increased in recent years, suggesting that the agricultural sector is gradually transitioning from traditional to higher value\nproducts where the country has a comparative advantage.\nYet, we currently have limited analytical and quantitative evidence of the actual changes that the agricultural sector is undergoing, how the sector is contributing\nto the rural transformation process, and whether and how it has contributed to the impressive poverty reduction in Bhutan in the recent years. This is despite a\nwealth of data: several governmental agencies and departments collect data on agricultural production and decision-making, poverty and resilience indicators, and\nthere is a global wealth of geospatial data available. The activity would address this evidence by integrating all the useful data and analyzing recent patterns in the\nagricultural and rural transformation process in Bhutan. Particular research questions could be: in which agricultural and forestry products does Bhutan have a\ncomparative advantage? How has growth in the agricultural sector contributed to jobs creation, labor reallocation, and poverty reduction in Bhutan? What are the\nexpected outcomes from inducing more agricultural productivity growth and trade on rural areas? Which crops and areas are most vulnerable to natural disasters,\nhuman-wildlife conflict, disease past attacks, and the impacts of climate change?\n",
    "solution_beneficiaries": "\nThe direct beneficiaries would be Bhutanese policy makers in the agricultural and rural sector to improve their decision making using big data and empricial\nevidence. The indirect beneficiaries are actors in the agricultural value chain - ranging from farmers, to traders and comsumers, who would benefit from better\ninformation and informed. evidence-based decision making.\n            "
