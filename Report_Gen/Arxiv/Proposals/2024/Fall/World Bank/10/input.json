    "ultimate_goal": "The ultimate goal of this project is to build an interactive digital map of health facilities by highlighting those that are facing the double-burden or dual challenges\nof low health system performance due to lack of basic infrastructures and increasing vulnerability to climate change and environmental hazards. The project also\nintends to do a thorough empirical assessment of the relationship between extreme weather events (namely heavy rainfall/flooding, and heat stress) and maternal\nand children health outcomes at the district and health facility level is key to further understand the nexus between climate change and health in the country.",
    "additional_comments": "The students would be supporting wit these two core tasks:\n1) Empirically assess the relationship between extreme weather events due to climate change (namely flooding due to heavy rainfall and heat stress) and maternal\nand children health outcomes at the health facility and district level. To achieve this objective, the team intends to use geo-coded and satellite historical seasonal\ndata (time-series) on climate-related risks and extreme weather events from the World Bank Climate Knowledge portal ; IMF climate data and IPCC data portals\ncombined with spatial and monthly data on maternal and children health outcomes from the country\u2019s DHIS2 (District Health Information System).\n2) Build a resilience-sensitive Health Facility geotagged prioritization map highlighting Primary Health Care centers and hospitals to prioritize based on their overall\nhealth system performance to deliver basic quality health services and their vulnerability risks to climate change. To achieve this objective, the team intends to use\nexhaustive geo-coded data from the general evaluation of health facilities concluded in July 2023 combined with geo-spatial and satellite data on climate risks\nincluding flooding and heat stress from the World Bank Climate Knowledge portal ; IMF climate data , IPCC data and the United Nations Satellite Centre\n(UNOSAT)."
