# **World Bank Capstone Proposal**
#### KOBIKISA / P167890
#### Proposed by: World Bank Group
#### World Bank Technical Lead: Soazic Elise Wang Sonne
#### Email: firstname_lastname@worldbank.org
#### Advisor(s): Amir Jafari & Edwin Lo
#### The George Washington University, Washington DC  
#### Data Science Program


### **PROJECT INFORMATION:**
#### 1. What is your name?  
Soazic Elise Wang Sonne


#### 2. What is the full name of your unit?
##### e.g., LAC Transportation or Energy Global Practice
HAWH3


#### 3. What is the name and P-code for your project?
KOBIKISA / P167890


#### 4. Are you the TTL / Project Lead? If not, please enter their name and email here:
Djibrilla Karamoko


#### 5. Please list other team members involved in the project:
Soazic Elise Wang Sonne, Aubain Lepassa



### **CHALLENGE:**
#### 6. Where is your challenge? 
##### i.e., which county, city, country, and/or region
Republic of Congo


#### 7. What is the challenge you are trying to solve?
Build a resilience-sensitive Health Facility geotagged prioritization map and empirically assess the nexus between climate change, WASH and health outcomes at
the health facility level


#### 8. Who would be the beneficiaries of the solution?

government, citizens, world bank
            



### **STATUS AND TIMELINE:**
#### 9. What is the status of your project/challenge?
##### e.g., early ideation; concept note; supervision; etc.
Concept note
            



#### 10. Are there milestones or hard deadlines we should be aware of? If so, please describe: 

Yes; September 2024
            


#### 11. Does the team have a technical lead who could regularly meet with the students? 
Yes



### **DATA:**
#### 12. What is the approximate size of your dataset to be analyzed by the students?
##### e.g., 100 GB
5


#### 13. Type of data? 

1. Time series/Panel data
2. Satellite Data
            


#### 14. Could you please provide more details regarding the nature of the data?

We have a micro-level geo-coded dataset of health facilities to be combined with various satellite and climate change/ Weather geocoded datasets.
            


#### 15. It is important that students can begin their project work as soon as their course commences, to ensure completion
before the close of their semester. Could the students immediately access the data upon project commencement? If your data requires additional World Bank
credentials to gain access, could you commit to helping the student gain the necessary credentials within 10-days of the start of the project?  Are there other uncertainties around data access that the program should be aware of? e.g., If the project requires student access to data not owned by the World Bank, students may need to be hired as non-fee STCs.
yes the dataset could be freely made available to the students right away



#### 16. Would the team be able to provide a sample of data if the project is preselected?
Yes


#### 17. What is the ultimate goal of this project? Is it more about finding interesting insights from the data, or is it more about making
accurate predictions, or something else? Does the data have the essential information (important features and/or labels) to accomplish this goal?
The ultimate goal of this project is to build an interactive digital map of health facilities by highlighting those that are facing the double-burden or dual challenges
of low health system performance due to lack of basic infrastructures and increasing vulnerability to climate change and environmental hazards. The project also
intends to do a thorough empirical assessment of the relationship between extreme weather events (namely heavy rainfall/flooding, and heat stress) and maternal
and children health outcomes at the district and health facility level is key to further understand the nexus between climate change and health in the country.


#### 18. Any additional comments or links to further information?
The students would be supporting wit these two core tasks:
1) Empirically assess the relationship between extreme weather events due to climate change (namely flooding due to heavy rainfall and heat stress) and maternal
and children health outcomes at the health facility and district level. To achieve this objective, the team intends to use geo-coded and satellite historical seasonal
data (time-series) on climate-related risks and extreme weather events from the World Bank Climate Knowledge portal ; IMF climate data and IPCC data portals
combined with spatial and monthly data on maternal and children health outcomes from the country’s DHIS2 (District Health Information System).
2) Build a resilience-sensitive Health Facility geotagged prioritization map highlighting Primary Health Care centers and hospitals to prioritize based on their overall
health system performance to deliver basic quality health services and their vulnerability risks to climate change. To achieve this objective, the team intends to use
exhaustive geo-coded data from the general evaluation of health facilities concluded in July 2023 combined with geo-spatial and satellite data on climate risks
including flooding and heat stress from the World Bank Climate Knowledge portal ; IMF climate data , IPCC data and the United Nations Satellite Centre
(UNOSAT).
